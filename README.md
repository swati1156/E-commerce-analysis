# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing an e-commerce database using SQL. The goal is to derive actionable insights from customer, product, and order data for understanding customer distribution, product performance, and market trends, which can be used for targeted marketing, inventory management, and business strategy optimization.

## Project Objectives

- **Analyze customer distribution** to identify key markets and customer segments.
- **Evaluate product performance** based on sales data to identify high-revenue items and trends.
- **Segment customers** based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies.
- **Understand market trends** to optimize logistics and business operations.

## Insights & Recommendations

- **Implement targeted marketing campaigns** to address the decline in the customer base, specifically in underperforming areas like **February**.
- Restock for *September* and *December* in advance, and hire additional staff to **handle increased demand**.
- **Improve the visibility** of underperforming products (those purchased by less than 40% of customers) to boost sales.
- Focus marketing strategies on *Delhi, Chennai, and Jaipur* to tap into potential **high-performing regions**.
- **Maintain frequent stock checks** for *Product ID 7* due to its high turnover rate.
- **Optimize marketing efforts** toward *Electronics*, as they are in high demand.
- **The Engagement Depth Analysis** shows that as the number of orders *increases*, the customer count *decreases* suggesting most of the customers are **Occasional shoppers**. Develop strategies to convert Occasional shoppers into regular customers, perhaps through **loyalty programs or personalized offers**.
